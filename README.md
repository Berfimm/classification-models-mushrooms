#Applying six classification model
I  compared the models according to their performance by using different classification models in the mushroom data set.
I used Decisicion Tree Classifier,Random Forest Classifier,KNN,SVC,Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
By comparing the models I used, I can determine the most suitable model for our data set.
